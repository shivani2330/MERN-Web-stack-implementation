To start out with the frontend of the To-do app, we will use the create-react-app command to scaffold our app.

In the same root directory as your backend code, which is the Todo directory, run:

npx create-react-app client

This will create a new folder in your Todo directory called client, where you will add all the react code.

npm install concurrently --save-dev
npm install nodemon --save-dev
