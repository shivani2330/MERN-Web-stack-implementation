npm install mongoose

We will also use models to define the database schema . 

This is important so that we will be able to define the fields stored in each Mongodb document. 

(Seems like a lot of information, but not to worry, everything will become clear to you over time. I promise!!!)

In essence, the Schema is a blueprint of how the database will be constructed, including other data fields that may not be required to be stored in the database.

 These are known as virtual properties

To create a Schema and a model, install mongoose which is a Node.js package that makes working with mongodb easier.

Tip: All three commands above can be defined in one line to be executed consequently with help of && operator, like this:

mkdir models && cd models && touch todo.js

Then update the api.js (the route code with the db details)
