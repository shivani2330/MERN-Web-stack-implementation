JavaScript is a language created to make HTML pages more interactive, while being easy to program with.
E.g. to check if a user’s input in a text field is valid.

It’s even used for server-side programming, i.e. back-end development. 
To do so, you often need to run programs using the console. 
Since JavaScript was only run by the browser in HTML documents, Node.js was created.

Node.js allows you to write programs in JavaScript which can be run outside the browser.
